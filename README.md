# Remark Template

My personal template (basically just custom css and a bit of tidying up) for [gnab's remark markdown
presentation tool](https://github.com/gnab/remark/tree/master).

This is an offline setup, so no relying on the internet to pull down fonts! woo. 

If you use this template / css, you will need to have `Hack Nerd Font Mono` installed on your system.
